# php-mysql-feedback-app

**Campaign Feedback System**
**Project Overview:**
This project is a basic web application designed to collect and manage feedback for a political campaign. It serves as a learning exercise to demonstrate fundamental web development concepts, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
/***************************************************************************************************/
**Key Features:**
-HTML form for capturing user feedback
-PHP script to process form data and store it in a MySQL database
-PHP script to retrieve and display stored feedback

**Setup:**
**Local Environment:** Ensure you have a local development environment with PHP, MySQL, and a web server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP) installed and running.
**Database Creation:** Create a MySQL database named campaign_feedback with a table named feedback having the following columns:
id (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
name (VARCHAR(100))
email (VARCHAR(100))
feedback (TEXT)
rating (INT)
submission_date (DATETIME, default to current timestamp)
/***************************************************************************************************/
**File Structure:**
feedback_form.html: Contains the HTML form for user input.
submit_feedback.php: Handles form submission and stores data in the database.
view_feedback.php: Retrieves and displays stored feedback.

**Usage:**
Access feedback_form.html in a web browser.
Fill out the form with your feedback and submit.
The submitted data will be stored in the feedback table.
Access view_feedback.php to view the collected feedback.

**Note:**
_This project is a basic implementation and may require additional features like user authentication, data validation, and error handling for production use.
For styling, consider using CSS to enhance the user interface.
JavaScript can be added for form validation and dynamic elements._
**
Potential Improvements:**
_Implement user authentication to restrict access to admin features.
Enhance data visualization to provide insights into feedback.
Add error handling and user feedback messages.
This project provides a foundation for learning web development concepts and can be expanded upon to create a more robust feedback system._
